            "text/plain": "['Last year, a top official from big-three credit bureau Experian told Congress that the firm was not aware of any consumers that had been harmed by an incident in which a business unit of Experian sold consumer records directly to an online identity theft service for nearly 10 months. Today’s post presents evidence that among the ID theft service’s clients was an identity theft and credit card fraud ring of at least 32 people who were arrested last year for\\xa0allegedly using\\xa0the information to steal millions from more \\xa0than 1,000 victims across the country.',\n 'Ngo’s ID theft service superget.info',\n 'On March 31, 2014, 26-year-old Idris Soyemi of Brooklyn, New York pleaded guilty in a New Hampshire court to one count of wire fraud. In Soyemi’s guilty plea hearing, the prosecutor\\xa0laid out how Soyemi on several occasions bought Social Security numbers, dates of birth and other personal information from an online identity theft service run by guy named Hieu Minh Ngo.',\n 'Ngo is a Vietnamese national who for several years ran an online identity theft service called superget.info. Shortly after my 2011 initial story about his service, Ngo tauntingly renamed his site to findget.me. The Secret Service took him up on that challenge, and succeeded in luring him out of Vietnam into Guam, where he was arrested and brought to New Hampshire for trial. He pleaded guilty earlier this year to running the ID theft service, and the government has been working on rounding up his customers ever since.',\n 'According to Soyemi’s guilty plea transcript\\xa0(PDF), U.S. Secret Service agents seized control over Ngo’s email account in February 2013 and used it to interact with his customers. Posing as Ngo, the undercover agent reached out to Soyemi and wrote, “I’m back. You doing tax refund or credit card?”, asking Soyemi whether he was buying personal data on consumers to set up new lines of credit in their names or to file fraudulent tax refund requests with the IRS — a rapidly growing form of cybercrime. Soyemi responded, “I do credit cards but can you tell me about tax refund?” (if you missed last month’s story about an Ohio man who’s accused of using Ngo’s service to file at least 150 fraudulent tax refund requests with the IRS, check that\\xa0out here).',\n 'Interestingly, Soyemi was part of a huge network of nearly three dozen people who were rounded up last year and charged with taking out new credit cards in victims’ names and then using the cards to make millions of dollars in retail purchases that were then fenced on the black market. From an April 2013 story in the Jersey Journal:',\n '“The leaders of the group, authorities say, purchased the identities of unsuspecting victims from online brokers, who got the information from computer hackers across the United States….”',\n '“In a process known as ‘punching,’ electronic account information from the cards’ magnetic strips would be transferred onto counterfeit cards, which were provided to “strikers” who conducted the purchases at retailers all over the Eastern Seaboard, authorities say…”',\n '….”The investigation has identified nearly 1,000 victims across the country and millions of dollars in phony transactions, authorities say.”',\n '“Authorities say the suspects spent the proceeds on luxury cars, high-end jewelry and other lavish expenses. Some of the money was additionally sent to accounts in Nigeria, authorities say.”',\n 'Further tying this group to Ngo’s service is a four-count indictment\\xa0(PDF) lodged against another man named in that identity theft ring roundup by the New Jersey prosecutor’s office: Oluwaseun Adekoya, 25, of Sewaren, NJ. Adekoya’s indictment makes numerous references to his alleged purchase of hundreds of consumer records from an online identity theft service that was taken over by U.S. Secret Service agents in February 2013 (recall that in Soyemi’s guilty plea hearing government prosecutors said that in that same month undercover Secret Service agents assumed control of the email account tied to Ngo’s identity theft service).',\n 'According to the government, Adekoya was a ringleader among the group who directed the activities of several men, including Atlanta, Ga. resident\\xa0Adebayo Adegbesan, another defendant in the identity theft ring who pleaded guilty in New Hampshire recently. A transcript of Adegbesan’s guilty plea hearing doesn’t mention Ngo, but it does reveal that the New Hampshire district court and the U.S. Attorney who is prosecuting the case — Arnold Huftalen — have their hands full processing a large number of defendants tied to the same case.',\n 'Prosecutors told the court that they’d hoped to lure Adekoya to New Hampshire after he’d arranged to collect what he believed was more than $100,000 worth of bank account information encoded onto white plastic cards that could be used to pull cash out of ATMs. Instead, Adekoya allegedly sent Adegbesan and three others to pick up the cards.',\n 'I enjoyed reading the discussion between the court and Huftalen, particularly the part about the “SODDI defense.” Here, the two are discussing the large number of defendants related to this case. Also, as it turns out, Matthew O’Neil — the U.S. Secret Service agent who came up with the plan to lure Ngo out of Vietnam and to entice his clients into traveling to New Hampshire — was recently honored with the Secret Service Agent of the Year award for his work on the case.',\n 'THE COURT: Okay. Fine. Just curious because I’ve seen a few of them come through now. Maybe related to this, maybe unrelated to this. I seem to have a number of these with you right now.',\n 'MR. HUFTALEN: I have more than I’d like, and\\xa0I’m sure you do, too.',\n 'THE COURT: People are told to come up to New\\xa0Hampshire and do this stuff. It’s a good approach. You\\xa0end up catching a lot of people.',\n 'MR. HUFTALEN: The whole lure, I mean, is to\\xa0eliminate this SODDI defense, S-O-D-D-I, some other dude did it. When you’re talking with somebody on the\\xa0computer, as you know, unless you have eyes on him on\\xa0the keyboard, there’s always that reasonable doubt.',\n 'THE COURT: It’s a very effective law enforcement technique. Believe me, I’m not in any way being critical of it. I’m curious about it and I of course want to see that, to the extent I have responsibilities with respect to it, that I fulfill those responsibilities, and I’m just learning about it, trying to understand it.',\n 'MR. HUFTALEN: I don’t think you will see a whole lot more of these.',\n 'THE COURT: It seems like you have a very creative active agent who’s working with you on at least some of these cases and I just was wondering.',\n 'MR. HUFTALEN: Who was in Washington, D.C. this week to get an award because he was selected as the Secret Service Agent of the year.',\n 'THE COURT: Really. That’s what I mean. He seems like a go-getter kind of person and people like that tend to produce lots of cases.',\n 'MR. HUFTALEN: And the targets that he and I are targeting are not like the person who’s sitting here in court today.',\n 'THE COURT: They’re people above him.',\n 'MR. HUFTALEN: Way above.',\n 'Several state attorneys general are now investigating the apparent breach at Experian’s subsidiary. According to U.S. government investigators, the data was not obtained directly from Experian, but rather via Columbus, Ohio-based US Info Search. US Info Search had a contractual agreement with a California company named Court Ventures, whereby customers of Court Ventures had access to the US Info Search data as well as Court Ventures’ data, and vice versa. Experian came into the picture in March 2012, when it purchased Court Ventures (along with all of its customers — including Mr. Ngo). For almost ten months after Experian completed that acquisition, Ngo continued siphoning consumer data and making his wire transfers.',\n 'A transcript (PDF) of Ngo’s guilty plea proceedings shows that his ID theft business attracted more than 1,300 customers who paid at least $1.9 million between 2007 and Feb. 2013 to look up Social Security numbers, dates of birth, addresses, previous addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and other sensitive data on more than three million Americans. Meanwhile, Experian has maintained that “no Experian database was accessed” in the fraud stemming from Ngo’s identity theft service. Check out a fact-checked version of Experian’s talking points on the matter here.',\n '\\n\\n\\n ',\n \"Tags: Adebayo Adegbesan, Arnold Huftalen, Experian breach, findget.me, Hieu Minh Ngo, Idris Soyemi, Matthew O'Neil, Oluwaseun Adekoy, superget.info\",\n '\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis entry was posted on Monday, May 19th, 2014 at 12:04 am\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand is filed under Other, Tax Refund Fraud.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYou can follow any comments to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBoth comments and pings are currently closed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n',\n '“Experian has maintained that “no Experian database was accessed” in the fraud stemming from Ngo’s identity theft service.”',\n 'Seems to me Experian is asserting a little SOFDI smokescreen of its own.

Getting the defendants to travel to there, as stated in the linked complaints, helps prosecutors avoid the “some other dude did it” or SODDI defense.',\n 'BRAVO BRIAN KREBS BRAVO…… WILL THANK U LATER',\n 'According to the indictment, the defendant was charged with attempting to defraud banks located in New Hampshire.',\n '“…the defendant …  devised a scheme and artifice to defraud several “financial institutions” (as that term is defined in 18 U.S.C. §20) including Peoples United Bank in Manchester, NH and St. Mary’s Bank in Manchester, NH…”',\n 'And in addition, the undercover agent was located in NH, and the defendant was lured to NH to obtain fake cards and used them at NH ATMs. It’s all in the indictment that Brian links to.',\n '“the defendant, …communicated with an individual who, unbeknownst to the defendant, was an undercover agent located in New Hampshire, with respect to planning and carrying out a scheme whereby the defendant would travel to New Hampshire, and would cause others to travel to New Hamp shire, for the sole purpose of using approximately two hundred (200) white plastic cards (which the defendant believed were encoded with actual bank account info rmation) to fraudulently obtain money and funds from ATMs in New Hampshire. “',\n 'i understand that…but why New Hampshire?  seems like something more sophisticated places in usa would do…i always thought NH was the West Virginia of the north.',\n '“The recipe for perpetual ignorance is: Be satisfied with your opinions and content with your knowledge.”',\n 'Get out your map of the U.S.A. and you’ll see that West Virginia isn’t in the south.

It seems to me that the Experian’s bad/misfeasant actors sold the data to the wrong person/people.  This seems to be either poor judgment, a systemic problem(s) at Experian, negligence, ineptitude or criminal activity at Experian.  ',\n 'How do we expose the bad actors at Experian who were involved in this, for whatever reason?  How do we make sure that these bad actors never again have the opportunity to sell our sensitive data, at any company?  How do we force Experian and others to be more forthcoming, honest, transparent in matters like this?',\n 'You don’t – their entire business model relies upon cheaply accumulating and selling data about as many people as they can.  Spending a lot of money vetting the data breaks their profits, as does vetting the customers. Step one would be imposing strong regulation, which would quickly find their way of doing business unethical and unsupportable in the long run, so because of their power and money that will never happen.',\n 'Errata:  “you diligence” should be “your diligence” .',\n 'Interesting   stuff,  I need to check out those PDF files',\n 'Very interesting case. I agree with Jerry, I think that exposing the people who were involved in this is definitely necessary to solve the problem completely and prevent it from happening again. What do you think the first step in this process should be? And how can people know whether or not to trust employees of Experian in the future once this problem is resolved?',\n 'The problem lies squarely with Experian in this breach since they have the deep pockets, the resources and obligation to prevent it.  The only way to have them provide better security is through fines and law suits from every fraudulence use of their information.  Consumers should be able to request that their information be removed from their databases.  If the data isn’t their its less likely to be compromised and consumers can then make other arrangements with vendors for providing personal information.  Once upon a time, this is how it was done.',\n 'Thanks for the insights, Brian.  It took me a couple of read-through a to realize that SODDI stands for “some other guy did it.”   It’s a shady situation and your dry wit helps to maintain a sense of humor about an otherwise crummy situation.  I hope many Congressional aides are on your distribution list.

After all, they don’t suffer if a breach occurs. Experian tops it all, with no regard to users at all. Even if they turn out to be innocent, their attitude is one that does not suggest any worry about how many people got their data stolen through their services …',\n 'Related to this there is also the technical side, in addition to the moral and legal side.

Domain experts called corp.com dangerous because years of testing showed whoever wields it would have access to an unending stream of passwords, email and other sensitive data from hundreds of thousands of Microsoft Windows PCs at major companies around the globe. This week, Microsoft Corp. agreed to buy the domain in a bid to keep it out of the hands of those who might abuse its awesome power.', '', 'Wisconsin native Mike O’Connor, who bought corp.com 26 years ago but has done very little with it since, said he hoped Microsoft would buy it because hundreds of thousands of confused Windows PCs are constantly trying to share sensitive data with corp.com. Also, early versions of Windows actually encouraged the adoption of insecure settings that made it more likely Windows computers might try to share sensitive data with corp.com.', 'From February’s piece:', 'At issue is a problem known as “namespace collision,” a situation where domain names intended to be used exclusively on an internal company network end up overlapping with domains that can resolve normally on the open Internet.', 'Windows computers on an internal corporate network validate other things on that network using a Microsoft innovation called\\xa0Active Directory, which is the umbrella term for a broad range of identity-related services in Windows environments. A core part of the way these things find each other involves a Windows feature called “DNS name devolution,” which is a kind of network shorthand that makes it easier to find other computers or servers without having to specify a full, legitimate domain name for those resources.', 'For instance, if a company runs an internal network with the name internalnetwork.example.com, and an employee on that network wishes to access a shared drive called “drive1,” there’s no need to type “drive1.internalnetwork.example.com” into Windows Explorer; typing “\\\\\\\\drive1\\\\” alone will suffice, and Windows takes care of the rest.', 'But things can get far trickier with an internal Windows domain that does not map back to a second-level domain the organization actually owns and controls. And unfortunately, in early versions of Windows that supported Active Directory —\\xa0Windows 2000 Server, for example — the default or example Active Directory path was given as “corp,” and many companies apparently adopted this setting without modifying it to include a domain they controlled.', 'Compounding things further, some companies then went on to build (and/or assimilate) vast networks of networks on top of this erroneous setting.', 'Now, none of this was much of a security concern back in the day when it was impractical for employees to lug their bulky desktop computers and monitors outside of the corporate network. But what happens when an employee working at a company with an Active Directory network path called “corp” takes a company laptop to the local Starbucks?', 'Chances are good that at least some resources on the employee’s laptop will still try to access that internal “corp” domain. And because of the way DNS name devolution works on Windows, that company laptop online via the Starbucks wireless connection is likely to then seek those same resources at “corp.com.”', 'In practical terms, this means that whoever controls corp.com can passively intercept private communications from hundreds of thousands of computers that end up being taken outside of a corporate environment which uses this “corp” designation for its Active Directory domain.', 'The story went on to describe how years of testing — some of which was subsidized by grants from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security — showed hundreds of thousands of Windows computers were constantly trying to send this domain information it had no business receiving, including attempts to log in to internal corporate networks and access specific file shares on those networks.', 'O’Connor told me he was selling the domain after doing basically nothing with it for 26 years because he was getting on in years and didn’t want his kids to inherit this mess. When he put the domain up for sale, I asked if he’d agree to let me know if and when he sold it.', 'On Monday evening, he wrote to say that Microsoft had agreed to purchase it. O’Connor said he could\\xa0 not discuss the terms of the deal, nor could he offer further comment beyond acknowledging the sale of corp.com to Microsoft.', 'In a written statement, Microsoft said it acquired the domain to protect its customers.', '“To help in keeping systems protected we encourage customers to practice safe security habits when planning for internal domain and network names,” the statement reads. “We released a security advisory in June of 2009 and a security update that helps keep customers safe. In our ongoing commitment to customer security, we also acquired the Corp.com domain.”', 'Over the years, Microsoft has shipped\\xa0several\\xa0software updates\\xa0to help decrease the likelihood of namespace collisions that\\xa0could create a security problem\\xa0for companies that still rely on Active Directory domains that do not map to a domain they control.', 'However, experts say hardly any vulnerable organizations have deployed these fixes for two reasons. First, doing so requires the organization to take down its entire Active Directory network simultaneously for some period of time.', 'Second, according to Microsoft applying the patch(es) will likely break or at least slow down a number of applications that the affected organization relies upon for day-to-day operations. Faced with either or both of these scenarios, most affected companies probably decided the actual risk of not applying these updates was comparatively low.', 'It should be noted that while Microsoft’s purchase of corp.com will safeguard companies that built Active Directory infrastructures on top of “corp” or “corp.com,” any company that has tied their internal Active Directory network to a domain they do not control is opening itself to a similar potential security nightmare.', 'Further reading:', 'Mitigating the Risk of DNS Namespace Collisions\\xa0(PDF)', 'DEFCON 21 – DNS May Be Hazardous to your Health (Robert Stucke)', 'Mitigating the Risk of Name Collision-Based Man-in-the-Middle Attacks\\xa0(PDF)', '\\n\\n\\n ', \"Tags: Active Directory, corp.com, microsoft, Mike O'Connor\", '\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis entry was posted on Tuesday, April 7th, 2020 at 8:34 am\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand is filed under A Little Sunshine.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYou can follow any comments to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYou can skip to the end and leave a comment.

Nobody said you need to spend the 1.7 mil right away…  and if people can survive and live off of minimum wage, I am quite sure getting 1.7 mil would suffice.
