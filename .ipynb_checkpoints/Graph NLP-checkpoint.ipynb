          "text": "Microsoft <S-ORG> today released updates to fix 113 security vulnerabilities in its various Windows <S-MISC> operating systems and related software. Those include at least three flaws that are actively being exploited, as well as two others which were publicly detailed prior to today, potentially giving attackers a head start in figuring out how to exploit the bugs., Nineteen of the weaknesses fixed on this Patch Tuesday were assigned Microsoft’s <S-MISC> most-dire “critical” rating, meaning malware or miscreants could exploit them to gain complete, remote control over vulnerable computers without any help from users., Near the top of the heap is CVE-2020-1020, a remotely exploitable bug in the Adobe <B-ORG> Font <I-ORG> Manager <E-ORG> library that was first detailed in late March when Microsoft <S-ORG> said it had seen the flaw being used in active attacks., The Adobe <B-ORG> Font <I-ORG> Manager <E-ORG> library is the source of yet another zero-day flaw — CVE-2020-0938 — although experts at security vendor Tenable <S-ORG> say there is currently no confirmation that the two are related to the same set of in-the-wild attacks. Both flaws could be exploited by getting a Windows <S-MISC> users to open a booby-trapped document or viewing one in the Windows <B-MISC> Preview <I-MISC> Pane., <E-MISC> The other zero-day flaw (CVE-2020-1027) affects Windows <B-MISC> 7 <E-MISC> and Windows <B-MISC> 10 <E-MISC> systems, and earned a slightly less dire “important” rating from Microsoft <S-ORG> because it’s an “elevation of privilege” bug that requires the attacker to be locally authenticated., Many security news sites are reporting that Microsoft <S-ORG> addressed a total of four zero-day flaws this month, but it appears the advisory for a critical Internet <B-MISC> Explorer <E-MISC> flaw (CVE-2020-0968) has been revised to indicate Microsoft <S-ORG> has not yet received reports of it being used in active attacks. However, the advisory says this IE bug is likely to be exploited soon., Researchers at security firm Recorded <B-ORG> Future <E-ORG> zeroed in on CVE-2020-0796, a critical vulnerability dubbed “SMBGhost” <S-MISC> that was rumored to exist in last month’s Patch Tuesday but for which an out-of-band patch wasn’t released until March 12. The problem resides in a file-sharing component of Windows, <S-MISC> and could be exploited merely by sending the victim machine specially-crafted data packets. Proof-of-concept code showing how to exploit the bug was released April 1, but so far there are no indications this method has been incorporated into malware or active attacks., Recorded Future’s Allan <B-ORG> Liska notes <E-ORG> that one reason these past few months have seen so many patches from Microsoft <S-ORG> is the company recently hired “SandboxEscaper,” a nickname used by the security researcher responsible for releasing more than a half-dozen zero-day flaws against Microsoft <S-ORG> products last year., “SandboxEscaper <S-ORG> has made several contributions to this month’s Patch <B-ORG> Tuesday,” <I-ORG> Liska <E-ORG> said. “This is great news for Microsoft <S-ORG> and the security community at large.”, Once again, Adobe <S-ORG> has blessed us with a respite from updating its Flash <B-MISC> Player <E-MISC> program with security fixes. I look forward to the end of this year, when the company has promised to sunset this buggy and insecure program once and for all. Adobe <S-ORG> did release security updates for its ColdFusion, After Effects and Digital <B-MISC> Editions <E-MISC> software., Speaking of buggy software platforms, Oracle <S-ORG> has released a quarterly patch update to fix more than 400 security flaws across multiple products, including its Java <B-MISC> SE <E-MISC> program. If you’ve got Java <S-MISC> installed and you need/want to keep it installed, please make sure it’s up-to-date., Now for my obligatory disclaimers. Just a friendly reminder that while many of the vulnerabilities fixed in today’s Microsoft <S-ORG> patch batch affect Windows <B-MISC> 7 <E-MISC> operating systems — including all three of the zero-day flaws — this OS is no longer being supported with security updates (unless you’re an enterprise taking advantage of Microsoft’s paid <S-ORG> extended security updates program, which is available to Windows <B-MISC> 7 <E-MISC> Professional and Windows <B-MISC> 7 <E-MISC> enterprise users)., If you rely on Windows <B-MISC> 7 <E-MISC> for day-to-day use, it’s to think about upgrading to something newer. That something might be a computer with Windows <B-MISC> 10. <E-MISC> Or maybe you have always wanted that shiny MacOS computer., If cost is a primary motivator and the user you have in mind doesn’t do much with the system other than browsing the Web, perhaps a Chromebook or an older machine with a recent version of Linux is the answer (Ubuntu may be easiest for non-Linux natives). Whichever system you choose, it’s important to pick one that fits the owner’s needs and provides security updates on an ongoing basis., Keep in mind that while staying up-to-date on Windows <S-MISC> patches is a must, it’s important to make sure you’re updating only after you’ve backed up your important data and files. A reliable backup means you’re not losing your mind when the odd buggy patch causes problems booting the system., So do yourself a favor and backup your files before installing any patches. Windows <B-MISC> 10 <E-MISC> even has some built-in tools to help you do that, either on a per-file/folder basis or by making a complete and bootable copy of your hard drive all at once., As always, if you experience glitches or problems installing any of these patches this month, please consider leaving a comment about it below; there’s a better-than-even chance other readers have experienced the same and may chime in here with some helpful tips. Also, keep an eye on the AskWoody <B-ORG> blog from Woody <I-ORG> Leonhard, <E-ORG> who keeps a close eye on buggy Microsoft <S-ORG> updates each month., Further reading:, Qualys breakdown on April 2020 Patch Tuesday, SANS Internet Storm Center on Patch Tuesday, \n\n\n , Tags: <B-ORG> Allan <I-ORG> Liska, <E-ORG> CVE-2020-0796, CVE-2020-0938, CVE-2020-1020, CVE-2020-1027, Recorded Future, Tenable, \n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis entry was posted on Tuesday, April 14th, 2020 at 6:24 pm\t\t\t\t\t\tand is filed under Time to Patch.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYou can follow any comments to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou can skip to the end and leave a comment.

I prefer the latter., Or use Acronis True Image to clone to a external USB hard drive !, True Image, which I have used for years, does no work with BitLocker., I prefer Macrium as well – but I won’t bother with a bootable copy, it is too much trouble to update – (unless maybe you could use a re-writable drive), I agree – bootable copy is not necessary. You can make multiple full image backups in Macrium <B-MISC> Reflect, <E-MISC> and you can verify them after making backups., Land sakes’ alive, B.K. is endorsing linux? Surely these are the end times we find ourselves in 🙂, When is Adobe going to be banned from PC? Or even Java <S-MISC> as far as that goes?, Yeah, I still got Win7, but it has been running better than ever since I bought Opatch <S-ORG> support! I am not a shill for anyone, I just can’t update my old PC to Win10, <S-ORG> and I can’t afford the huge support price MS wants to extend Win7. I looked at dual booting to Linux, <S-ORG> but they seem to have made the process even more complicated since just a few years ago!, The timing could nit be worse with people working from home and even some smaller businesses that can not address IT issues sufficiently with limited resources, limited access, and recently increasing limited control over the abrupt and unplanned situation of closures and layoffs while some are racing often with no trial to open and operate newly created online stores. Hopefully that is their due diligence checklist for red flagging any vulnerabilities now present., Just back up your data., Every thing else can be downloaded and start from fresh.\nDon’t back up your system, 90% Window$ crap., Get an ISO of the o/s ready., All our computers have defined disk c and d, with all the data on d. We backup d, and reinstall all the software we use on c. Since our main language is Java <S-MISC> we do not need to rely on the registry., Linux was good but now Microsoft <S-ORG> bought it and it’s just as bad as windows 10. They don’t make sure it works before they use the updates than; too bad too sad; it’s up to you to fix it!, Paul <B-PER> Micro$ft <E-PER> did not buy Linux <S-MISC> they just made it available in windows. Linux is still open source and I hope always will be. If Micro$oft <S-ORG> got a hold of it they would surely screw it up. I’ve been using Linux <B-ORG> Mint <E-ORG> for about a year now and no problems. Linux is not for everyone I know that but I am very satisfied using it. I have a dual boot set up with windows 10 but I rarely boot to windows just to update it occasionally., Bezos <S-ORG> wants a $ 10 billion federal contract for an IT infrastructure but I don’t see any Windows <S-MISC> with the name Amazon!, speaking of #patchmanagement does anyone have any good suggestions for cloud-based patch management for windows computers and common 3rd party apps like adobe, browsers, java? Something including repositories? I’m pretty sure most large/med size org’s are using combinations of WSUS/SCCM <S-ORG> that rely on things like client VPN access back to corporate data centers. Would be great to have an all-cloud solution with repo’s that doesn’t require access to corporate data centers. Heck, I’d even consider another new client on every computer, This is not, specifically, cloud-based, but it is something we use on premise and MAY have a cloud option: Ivanti <B-MISC> Security <I-MISC> Controls. <E-MISC> We maintain MS and third-party patching with this software, and it does a phenomenal job. Get in touch with the folks at Ivanti <S-ORG> and explain your needs, as they will likely have something. Bang for the buck, we have yet to find anything better., Microsoft <S-ORG> made Intune <S-ORG> just for you.\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune, For patch management in the cloud, consider Automox.com, Well thank you Microsoft <S-ORG> for runing my another system\nyear ago while using windows 7 one of updates corupt booting up corectly., And now they killed of my new laptop with windows 10, olso by faulty update Well Done Microsft your updates cause more danger than help., > Linux was good but now Microsoft <S-ORG> bought it and it’s just as bad as windows 10. , Don’t get high on your own supply., Name (required)\n, Email (required)\n, Website\n, Comment, , , Click image for my skimmer series., A <B-ORG> New <I-ORG> York <I-ORG> Times <E-ORG> Bestseller! , Badguy uses for your PC, Tools for a Safer PC , Spammers Duke it Out, Your email account may be worth far more than you imagine., eBanking Best Practices for Businesses, Innovations from the Underground, <B-ORG> ID <I-ORG> Protection <I-ORG> Services <E-ORG> Examined, The reasons for its decline, File 'em Before the Bad Guys Can , A crash course in carding. , Sign up, or Be Signed Up! , Finding out is not so easy. , ...For Online Safety. , \r\n\t\t© 2020 Krebs <S-PER> on Security. \r\n\t\t Powered by WordPress. \r\n Privacy Policy\n\n",

Just a friendly reminder that while\\xa0many of the vulnerabilities fixed in today’s Microsoft patch batch affect Windows 7 operating systems — including all three of the zero-day flaws —\\xa0this OS is no longer being supported with security updates (unless you’re an enterprise taking advantage of Microsoft’s\\xa0paid extended security updates program, which is available to Windows 7 Professional and Windows 7 enterprise users)., If you rely on Windows 7 for day-to-day use, it’s to think about upgrading to something newer. That something might be a computer with Windows 10. Or maybe you have always wanted that shiny MacOS computer., If cost is a primary motivator and the user you have in mind doesn’t do much with the system other than browsing the Web, perhaps a\\xa0Chromebook\\xa0or an older machine with a recent version of\\xa0Linux\\xa0is the answer (Ubuntu may be easiest for non-Linux natives). Whichever system you choose, it’s important to pick one that fits the owner’s needs and provides security updates on an ongoing basis., Keep in mind that while staying up-to-date on Windows patches is a must, it’s important to make sure you’re updating only after you’ve backed up your important data and files. A reliable backup means you’re not losing your mind when the odd buggy patch causes problems booting the system., So do yourself a favor and backup your files before installing any patches. Windows 10 even has\\xa0some built-in tools\\xa0to help you do that, either on a per-file/folder basis or by making a complete and bootable copy of your hard drive all at once., As always, if you experience glitches or problems installing any of these patches this month, please consider leaving a comment about it below; there’s a better-than-even chance other readers have experienced the same and may chime in here with some helpful tips. Also, keep an eye on the\\xa0AskWoody blog\\xa0from\\xa0Woody Leonhard, who keeps a close eye on buggy Microsoft updates each month., Further reading:, Qualys breakdown on April 2020 Patch Tuesday, SANS Internet Storm Center on Patch Tuesday, \\n\\n\\n , Tags: Allan Liska, CVE-2020-0796, CVE-2020-0938, CVE-2020-1020, CVE-2020-1027, Recorded Future, Tenable, \\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis entry was posted on Tuesday, April 14th, 2020 at 6:24 pm\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand is filed under Time to Patch.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYou can follow any comments to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYou can skip to the end and leave a comment.

I prefer the latter., Or  use  Acronis   True  Image  to  clone to a external  USB  hard drive  !, True Image, which I have used for years, does no work with BitLocker., I prefer Macrium as well – but I won’t bother with a bootable copy, it is too much trouble to update – (unless maybe you could use a re-writable drive), I agree – bootable copy is not necessary. You can make multiple full image backups in Macrium Reflect, and you can verify them after making backups., Land sakes’ alive, B.K. is endorsing linux?  Surely these are the end times we find ourselves in 🙂, When is Adobe going to be banned from PC? Or even Java as far as that goes?, Yeah, I still got Win7, but it has been running better than ever since I  bought Opatch support! I am not a shill for anyone, I just can’t update my old PC to Win10, and I can’t afford the huge support price MS wants to extend Win7. I looked at dual booting to Linux, but they seem to have made the process even more complicated since just a few years ago!, The timing could nit be worse with people working from home and even some smaller businesses that can not address IT issues sufficiently with limited resources, limited access, and recently increasing limited control over the abrupt and unplanned situation of closures and layoffs while some are racing often with no trial to open and operate newly created online stores. Hopefully that is their due diligence checklist for red flagging any vulnerabilities now present., Just back up your data., Every thing else can be downloaded and start from fresh.\\nDon’t back up your system, 90% Window$ crap., Get an ISO of the o/s ready., All our computers have defined disk c and d, with all the data on d. We backup d, and reinstall all the software we use on c. Since our main language is Java we do not need to rely on the registry., Linux was good but now Microsoft bought it and it’s just as bad as windows 10. They don’t make sure it works before they use the updates than; too bad too sad; it’s up to you to fix it!, Paul Micro$ft did not buy Linux they just made it available in windows. Linux is still open source and I hope always will be. If Micro$oft got a hold of it they would surely screw it up. I’ve been using Linux Mint for about a year now and no problems. Linux is not for everyone I know that but I am very satisfied using it. I have a dual boot set up with windows 10 but I rarely boot to windows just to update it occasionally., Bezos wants a $ 10 billion federal contract for an IT infrastructure but I don’t see any Windows with the name Amazon!, speaking of #patchmanagement does anyone have any good suggestions for cloud-based patch management for windows computers and common 3rd party apps like adobe, browsers, java? Something including repositories? I’m pretty sure most large/med size org’s are using combinations of WSUS/SCCM that rely on things like client VPN access back to corporate data centers. Would be great to have an all-cloud solution with repo’s that doesn’t require access to corporate data centers. Heck, I’d even consider another new client on every computer, This is not, specifically, cloud-based, but it is something we use on premise and MAY have a cloud option: Ivanti Security Controls.  We maintain MS and third-party patching with this software, and it does a phenomenal job.  Get in touch with the folks at Ivanti and explain your needs, as they will likely have something.  Bang for the buck, we have yet to find anything better., Microsoft made Intune just for you.\\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune, For patch management in the cloud, consider Automox.com, Well thank you Microsoft for runing my another system\\nyear ago while using windows 7 one of updates corupt booting up corectly., And now they killed of my new laptop
